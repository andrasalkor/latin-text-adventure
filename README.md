# Latin Text-Adventure
The up and coming Latin text-adventure game's official repository. Currently in early development.

## What is this?

A small Godot project for a text-adventure game, designed entirely in Latin. It is still in its early stages, with most of the features' skeletons, so to speak, implemented, but not with full systems in place yet. The goal is to make a good, comfortable command parser for Latin and a compelling sci-fi story of about 1-2 hours in playtime length.

If you are interested in designing text-adventure games in Godot, I recommend [jmbiv's YouTube series][https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpwc3ughKbZfkSPko3azFD4dd4IHSiQeE], which is what this project used as its basis as well.

## Why is this?

There is still a lot of content being created for Latin. New books, new videos, poetry, talks, conventions, and so many things to keep the tradition of using Latin alive. But what I find is that most of this content is about Latin itself, whereas Latin is really a fully functional language that can be used as a tool for communicating. 

Thus I embarked on a journey to create Latin content which is about a variety of subjects outside of the classical sphere. One of these projects is this Latin text-adventure game, which aims at intermediate (and above) speakers and readers of the language. Hopefully, when the project will be finished, Latinists around the world will be able to enjoy an old-school game with a compelling story in a (perhaps surprisingly, perhaps not so much) science fiction, fantasy setting.
